### Filter flight logic
- filter by ident (from aircraft) done
- filter by destination and time (from flights)
- further filter by dest and time
  - keep original flight data - done
  - show only filtered flight data - done
  - on flight click -> add to arr, handle filter
- Assumption: clicking on new aircraft clears rotation for a new aircraft
